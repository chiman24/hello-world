Learning GitHub workflow
Today is a good day.  I'm learning about GitHub.  I like learning new things.
Now, to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy - to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!  Amen.
